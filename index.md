 Welcome to my home page
=============

I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

I am interested in graph analysis, randomized algorithms, data analysis, and information theory. I am also interested in theoretical concepts related to machine learning and neural networks.

I should point out that I recently became familiar with the movement Tristan Harris started regarding humane technology and I encourage you to [get involved!](https://www.humanetech.com/get-involved).


  <h3>On-going Research:</h3>
  
  1. Clustering and graphical models
  2. Meta-learning
